Therefore, the first years of vegetation development substantially shape the trajectory of future vegetation recovery on former agricultural sites. Studies describing the abandonment of traditional, extensive agriculture are numerous, but what about intensively cultivated sites? This study covers the vegetation development in 47 plots in former maize fields in an intensive agricultural landscape in Belgium (Western Europe); fields were abandoned in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The woody canopy and the herbaceous understorey were recorded in 2006 (and in 2003 for the 2001 fields). The additional environmental variables measured were plot distance to seed trees and forest edges, soil nutrients, and soil pH. The colonization success of woody species in terms of abundance and species composition was highly variable between years, and presence–absence was hard to explain. However, the growth of the most abundant species (<jats:italic>Salix caprea</jats:italic> agg.) was positively related to a soil nutrient gradient. Whether or not a woody canopy did establish successfully was related to alternative trajectories of herbaceous vegetation development. Under a sparse canopy of woody species, fast‐growing, opportunistic species became dominant. A denser canopy favored a higher percentage of bare ground, which may have offered suitable sites for the recruitment of additional shrub and tree species. Apparently, strong agricultural legacies can be both beneficial and detrimental to vegetation recovery following abandonment.</jats:bold> </jats:p>","en","Restoration Ecology","2010-11-12, 2, published, Published, publication_history, Publication History","c(""https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1526-100X.2009.00627.x"", ""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00627.x""), c(""unspecified"", ""unspecified""), c(""vor"", ""vor""), c(""text-mining"", ""similarity-checking"")"

Parallel and strong vegetation shifts occurred in both ancient and post‐agricultural forest: the species diversity decreased and local species cover strongly diverged, which indicates community drift. The observed understorey changes did thus not support the commonly accepted model of community development in post‐agricultural forests, i.e. the diversity did not increase and the vegetation did not become more similar to the ancient forest vegetation over time. The changes in species composition were associated with an increase of common, competitive species at the expense of ancient forest indicator species.

Considerable work has been done on above-ground recovery but below-ground processes are less well understood. To determine changes in root mass during tropical secondary succession in lowland forests of Central Borneo, samples were taken from stands of increasing ages since abandonment of agriculture (1, 3, 14 and 31 y) with a primary forest control (six plots from 1-y-old stands and three from all other ages). Root mass and elemental concentrations were determined and soils were chemically analysed. There was no increase in root mass with stand age for fine-root (&lt; 2 mm diameter) or small-root (&lt; 5 mm diameter) mass but there was a trend for coarse-root mass (5–10 mm diameter) to increase with stand age. Negative correlations were shown between root mass and soil nutrient status. Fine-root C concentrations increased with stand age but there was no clear effect of stand age on fine-root N or P. Fine-root mass did not increase significantly with stand age suggesting a rapid recovery; instead, soil nutrient status appeared to be the most important factor controlling root mass. Of the soil nutrients measured in this study, N had a stronger control over root mass than P suggesting that this element may be limiting during secondary succession in tropical lowland forests of Borneo.</jats:p>","en","J.

A partir da pesquisa de campo com observações locais mapeamos as tensões em torno da própria criação da unidade de conservação e o papel que tiveram a população residente na luta por sua criação. O núcleo histórico da APARIS é a comunidade do Alto Santo, localizada na Vila Irineu Serra, o primeiro e único centro de Daime fundado por Raimundo Irineu Serra é o Centro de Iluminação Cristã Luz Universal Alto Santo (CICLU Alto Santo). E, pelo menos outros três centros que se formaram após o falecimento do Mestre Irineu.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>To evaluate the conservation effectiveness of tree group retention (in this case, buffer strips along streams), we studied the bryophyte community once prior to, and twice after logging, comparing one buffer and one clear‐cut plot (0·1 ha) in each of 13 riparian sites. We asked whether time‐lagged responses or recovery processes had dominated the period between two re‐inventories, 2·5 and 10·5 years after logging, focusing both on the whole community and on species of conservation concern.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Although there were examples of recovering species in both clear‐cuts and buffer strips, the similarity in species composition to predisturbance conditions had decreased in the second re‐inventory.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The red‐listed species had mostly declined during the first period, and the number of red‐list species per plot (mostly species growing on dead wood) was rather stable at &lt;20% of predisturbance levels in clear‐cuts and &lt;60% in buffer strips in the last re‐inventory.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis and applications</jats:italic>. We show that most extinctions of red‐list species occurred soon after disturbance and that the conclusions drawn from a study carried out 2·5 years after the disturbance did not change profoundly 8 years later. Although the species composition in the buffer strips continued to change over time, sensitive species survived much better in buffer strips than in clear‐cuts, which supports the practice of retaining buffer strips for terrestrial species too. This knowledge should encourage managers to find ways of increasing the efficacy of this practice. One obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind, which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

					</jats:bold> The floristic composition of the vegetation of mined and unmined sand dunes at Bridge Hill, in Myall Lakes National Park, was studied from 1982–90 inclusive. Data from mined sites ranging in age from 2–15 years post mining, with replication of time since mining in both time and space, were incorporated in the study. The mined part of the Bridge Hill dune is very different in plant species composition compared with either the dune prior to mining or to the adjacent unmined dunes. The mined dune also displays a temporal development of species composition over the period 2–15 years post mining, the dominant trend being a reduction in similarity to that of the dune prior to mining. Mining resulted in significant increases in the abundance of six introduced species, and in significant differences in the abundance of 49% of the native species. Species richness and diversity increased during the period 2–15 years post mining, and a significant component of this could be attributed to the presence of the introduced species.</jats:p>","en","Australian Journal of Ecology","c(""https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1442-9993.1992.tb00806.x"", ""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1992.tb00806.x""), c(""unspecified"", ""unspecified""), c(""vor"", ""vor""), c(""text-mining"", ""similarity-checking"")"

For forests to recover from logging, one would predict recruitment and growth processes to be accelerated in logged areas relative to unlogged areas, facilitating increased recruitment of trees into the adult size classes. We examined this prediction first by determining the growth of 4733 trees over a 51 to 56 month period and found that growth rates in the most heavily logged area were consistently slower than in the two unlogged areas. In contrast, the lightly logged forest had similar growth rates to unlogged areas in the small size classes, but trees in the 30 to 50 cm DBH size cohort exhibited elevated growth rates relative to the unlogged areas. Mortality was highest in the heavily logged areas, with many deaths occurring when healthy trees were knocked over by neighboring treefalls. We found no difference in the density or species richness of seedlings in the logged and unlogged forests. The number of seedlings that emerged from the disturbed soil (seed bank+seed rain) and initially seed‐free soil (seed rain) was greater in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest. However, sapling density was lower in the heavily logged areas, suggesting that there is a high level of seedling mortality in logged areas. We suggest that the level of canopy opening created during logging, the lack of aggressive colonizing tree species, elephant activity that is concentrated in logged areas, and an aggressive herb community, all combine to delay vegetation recovery in Kibale Forest.</jats:p>","en","Biotropica","2006-03-15, 2, published, Published, publication_history, Publication History","c(""https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1744-7429.1997.tb00035.x"", ""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1744-7429.1997.tb00035.x""), c(""unspecified"", ""unspecified""), c(""vor"", ""vor""), c(""text-mining"", ""similarity-checking"")"

Costa Rica. El cacaotal se considera como un ambiente perturbado debido a la introducción de un agrosistema. Se midieron 44 variables ambientales, encontrándose para la mayoría diferencias entre el bosque y el cacaotal, entre parcelas de muestreo diurno y nocturno, y entre los diferentes meses. Por ejemplo, la precipitación, el volumen y pro- fundidad de la hojarasca el volumen y profundidad de la hojarasca la cobertura de herbáceas y la humedad muestran variaciones estacionales. En el bosque existen más palmas, troncos, árboles con contrafuertes, árboles jóvenes y lianas que en el cacaotal- En comparación con el bosque, la capa de hojarasca es más profunda en el cacaotal, el cual además carece de un sotobosque bien definido. En términos de parámetros ambientales se concluye que el cacaotal es un habitat más variable y menos predecible que el bosque, lo cual no necesariamente implica que sea más inhóspito o severo. Se colectaron 1967 individuos de 47 especies de anfibios y reptiles. Se encontraron diferencias entre el número de especíese individuos del bosque y del cacaotal, las parcelas diurnas y nocturnas y los 13 meses. El mayor número de especies se encontró en el bosque, en el cual tuvo también la mayor diversidad. En el cacaotal se registraron los valores más altos de abundancia, densidad por parcela y dominancia. En este ambiente también se registraron los mayores valores de número total de individuos, agregación y densidad para las 5 especies más abundantes. El grado de dominancia encontrado en estos ambientes de bosque y cacaotal es mucho mayor que el conocido para los ecosistemas tropicales de hojarasca del Viejo Mundo. El número total de especies y de individuo, así como el número total de individuos de las especies principales siguen un marcado patrón estacional, alcanzando valores mayores hacia el final de la época seca en coincidencia con valores máximos de las poblaciones de artrópodos y de la profundidad de la capa de hojarasca. los artrópodos como recurso alimentario están repartidos entre las especies de la herpetofauna. Al comparar los contenidos estomacales con la abundancia de presas (obtenida con trampas de bote) se observó que algunas especies consumen los artrópodos proporcionalmente a su disponibilidad en la hojarasca. Algunas especies consumen presas pequeñas, principalmente ácaros y hormigas de cuerpo duro, mientras que otras consumen presas de mayor talla y cuerpo blando. Algunos de los especialistas, como Dendrobates pumilio, consumen hormigas de talla pequeña y en gran cantidad. Otros, como Gasírophryne pictiventris, en cambio consumen hormigas de gran tamaño y en cantidad reducida. Se discuten en detalle las dietas de las especies principales. Eleutherodactylus bransfordii y D. pumilio, las dos especies más abundantes, se distribuyen más densa y agregadamente en el cacaotal que en el bosque y tienen dietas diferentes: E. bransfordii consume pocas presas grandes en pro- porción similar a la de su disponibilidad, mientras que D. pum/V/o consume solamente ácaros y homigas pequeñas. Establezco como hipótesis: (i) que estas 2 especies son más existosas en ambientes perturbados e impredecibles, y (ii) que al inicio del abandono del cacaotal eran más dominantes pero con el trancurso del tiempo sus poblaciones en bosque y cacaotal alcanzarán la igualdad. Se requiere de estudios adicionales para determinar los factores limitantes de las poblaciones de estas 2 especies, uno de los cuales probablemente sea la competencia con otras especies aunque no hay evidencias para apoyar esta idea. Propongo que las poblaciones de E. bransfordii están limitadas por depredación . las poblaciones de D. pumilio. especie que contiene alcaloides tóxicos en la piel y no es preferida por los depredadores, pueden estar limitadas durante el período larvario debido a depredación y.'O competencia. Estas diferencias entre el bosque y el cacaotal asi como la marcada estacionalidad tanto para la hepetofauna como para varios parámetros ambientales, aún más marcada en el cacaotal, sugieren la necesidad de continuar con estudios sobre la estacionalidad de los trópicos con fines teóricos y prácticos. Propongo que la creciente destrucción de los trópicos propiciará cambios estacionales cada vez más pronunciados, lo cual debe ser entendido y considerado en cualquier intento de manejo de los trópicos o del estudio teórico sobre la sucesión tropical.</jats:p>","AZM","c(""https://azm.ojs.inecol.mx/index.php/azm/article/download/2050/2163"", ""https://azm.ojs.inecol.mx/index.php/azm/article/download/2050/2163""), c(""application/pdf"", ""unspecified""), c(""vor"", ""vor""), c(""text-mining"", ""similarity-checking"")"

Franco) forests near Kamloops, British Columbia, to compare the effects of different disturbance types (low and high severity fires and non-salvage logging), and to evaluate how seed banks contribute to post-disturbance vegetation establishment. Sites were selected to represent disturbances at 1, 5, and 10 years prior to sampling, and data were analyzed using nonparametric univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Seed density and species composition of seed banks did not differ significantly among the 1 year disturbed sites; however, the rooted frequencies of seed-origin plants in the establishing vegetation decreased in the order: lightly burned &gt; severely burned &gt; logged. Seed dispersal within the first year following fire is believed to be an important recovery mechanism on burned sites. Low frequencies of seed-derived plants, particularly conifer seedlings, on logged sites pose concerns for the initial recovery of vegetation following logging; nonetheless, the lack of significant differences in understory species composition between sites burned 5 years prior to sampling and sites logged 10 years prior to sampling, and their corresponding undisturbed sites, suggests that vegetation recovery can occur relatively quickly. Rooted frequencies of plants establishing naturally in burned areas were similar to those in undisturbed areas, which suggests that post-fire erosion control seeding using agronomic species may not be necessary in these forests. </jats:p>","en","Can.

Experimental Design: An automated sample preparation and analysis system for enumerating CTCs (Celltracks) was adapted for detecting IGF-1R positive CTCs with a diagnostic antibody targeting a different IGF-1R epitope to CP-751,871. This assay was utilized in three phase I trials of CP-751,871 as a single agent or with chemotherapy and was validated using cell lines and blood samples from healthy volunteers and patients with metastatic carcinoma. Results: There was no interference between the analytical and therapeutic antibodies. CP-751,871 was well tolerated as a single agent, and in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel, at doses ranging from 0.05 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. Eighty patients were enrolled on phase 1 studies of CP-751,871, with 47 (59%) patients having CTCs detected during the study. Prior to treatment 26 patients (33%) had CTCs, with 23 having detectable IGF-1R positive CTCs. CP-751,871 alone, and CP-751,871 with cytotoxic chemotherapy, decreased CTCs and IGF-1R positive CTCs; these increased towards the end of the 21-day cycle in some patients, falling again with retreatment. CTCs were commonest in advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer (11/20). Detectable IGF-1R expression on CTCs before treatment with CP-751,871 and docetaxel was associated with a higher frequency of PSA decline by more than 50% (6/10 vs 2/8 patients). A relationship was observed between sustained falls in CTCs counts and PSA declines by more than 50%. Conclusions: IGF-1R expression is detectable by immunofluorescence on CTCs. These data support the further evaluation of CTCs in pharmacodynamic studies and patient selection, particularly in advanced prostate cancer. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>","en","JCO"

At each of eight sites varying from 20 yr to 100 yr since abandonment, and at two old‐growth (&gt; 500 yr) forest stands, we established two 160‐m transects and sampled the surface 0–3 cm of soil in cores collected at each 5 m interval. Seed densities were estimated from the number of seedlings germinated from the soil over a six‐week period. Contrary to expectation, neither the density of the soil seed bank, nor species richness or diversity were directly related to age since abandonment, but the density of the soil seed bank was correlated with the abundance of seed‐bank‐forming species in the standing vegetation. In marked contrast to published studies, herbaceous taxa were rare even in the youngest stands, and the common tree species, which accounted for most seeds in the soil, were present in all stands. The pioneer tree <jats:italic>Miconia argentea</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Melastomataceae</jats:italic>) was the single most common species in the seed bank, accounting for 62% of seeds and present in 92% of soil samples.

The traits of seedlings, particularly biomass allocation and root traits, are more easily quantified than the traits of adults. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that seedling traits vary and trade‐off tracking the changing environment during secondary succession. We measured the major morphological traits of 27 dominant species and the major environmental factors in a chronosequence (30‐yr‐old fallow, 60‐yr‐old fallow, and old growth forest) after shifting cultivation in a tropical lowland rain forest on Hainan Island, China. The 30‐yr‐old fallow had higher light and nutrient availability, and the older forests had higher soil water content. Redundancy analysis based on species abundance and environmental factors revealed groups of seedlings that dominate in different stages of succession. Seedlings in different stages of succession had different strategies of biomass allocation for harvesting resources that varied in availability. Species characteristic of younger forest had higher allocation to roots and higher specific leaf area, while species characteristic of older forest had higher allocation to leaves. Our study suggests that the variations and trade‐offs in the major functional traits of tree seedlings among successional classes may reflect changes in environmental conditions during succession.</jats:p>","en","Biotropica","c(""2013-04-22"", ""2014-03-21"", ""2014-06-19""), 0:2, c(""received"", ""accepted"", ""published""), c(""Received"", ""Accepted"", ""Published""), c(""publication_history"", ""publication_history"", ""publication_history""), c(""Publication History"", ""Publication History"", ""Publication History"")","c(""National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection"", ""National Key Technology R & D Program"", ""National Nature Science Foundation of China"", ""National Nonprofit Institute Research Grant of Chinese Academy of Forestry""), c(""CAFRIFEEP201103"", ""2012BAD22B0103"", NA, ""CAFYBB2011004-02""), c(NA, NA, ""10.13039/501100001809"", NA), c(NA, NA, ""crossref"", NA), c(NA, NA, ""30901143"", NA), c(NA, NA, ""30430570"", NA)","c(""https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fbtp.12125"", ""https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fbtp.12125"", ""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/btp.12125""), c(""application/pdf"", ""unspecified"", ""unspecified""), c(""vor"", ""vor"", ""vor""), c(""text-mining"", ""text-mining"", ""similarity-checking"")"

Our objective was to determine the effects of distance from the forest border on successional vegetation structure and woody species richness along the chronosequence. Vegetation structure similar to that of mature forests recovered over 40–50 y, both close to (0–10 m) and away from (40–50 m) the border. Total woody species richness was similar for both distances but species composition differed significantly. When primary forest species were analysed separately, basal area, height, abundance and richness were all significantly higher close to the forest border. Primary species such as <jats:italic>Quercus</jats:italic> spp. (barochorous-synzoochorous) and <jats:italic>Carpinus caroliniana</jats:italic> (anemochorous) had lower basal area, density and height away from the border than close to it.
